#  Script to control Nvidia GPU fans.   Use at your own risk!
#
#  Tested with driver version 367 and cuda8rc on Ubuntu 16.  September 2016.
#
#  PREREQUISITES
#
#      GPU must be in persistence mode, ideally by running
#
#          /usr/bin/start-nvidia-persistenced
#
#      X server must be running (possibly one per GPU).
#      On headless systems, start X with the cool_gpu script.
#
#  To set fan speed to 65% on GPU 0 for Display :0,
#
#       nvscmd 65 -display :0
#
#  To restore automatic fan control,
#
#       nvscmd stop -display :0
#
#   To run forever enforcing the heuristic below (useful from xinit):
#
#       nvscmd run_forever -display :0
#
#   Executes heuristic for slightly more aggressive cooling, though
#   still not super loud (fine to keep in the next room).  A much
#   louder config could be used in a datacenter.  The difference on
#   my Titan X Pascal running for an hour+ compute job (GPU using
#   roughly ~175 watts, all compute no mem) at room temp (22 Celsius)
#
#        fan set to 100% -- runs at 97.2% of GPU peak freq (1847 out of 1901 MHz)
#                           too loud even for next room
#
#        this heuristic --- sustains 95.8% of peak freq (1822 out of 1901 MHz),
#                           quiet enough to be in the next room with open door,
#                           and whisper quiet when nothing running on GPU;
#                           temp around 63 degrees Celsius
#
#        default       ---  sustains 94.5% of peak freq (1797 out of 1901 MHz)
#                           and impressively quiet but with GPU temp around 73C,
#                           it's too hot to touch case near GPU exhaust
#
#   Relative to default, the heuristic improves perf by factor of 1.014 (1.4%),
#   and makes case cool enough that touching won't burn your finger.
#
#   Relative to 100% fan, the heuristic sacrafices 1.4% of perf to achieve
#   humanly tolerable noise levels.
