# Adapted for Nvidia Titan X Pascal Linux Driver 367
# by Boris Dimitrov <dimiroll@gmail.com> in 2016.
# Use at your own risk!
#
# Suggested installation:
#
#     Unpack somewhere, say in directory
#
#         ${HOME}/set-gpu-fans
#
#     and create a link there from /opt, like so
#
#         ln -sf ${HOME}/set-gpu-fans /opt/set-gpu-fans
#
# Already running an X server?
#
#     Make sure you are not running an X server.  This tool is meant
#     only for headless systems (no display attached).
#
# Suggested usage:
#
#    cd /opt/set-gpu-fans
#    sudo tcsh
#    ./cool_gpu >& controller.log &
#    tail -f controller.log
#
# Seems to work fine on headless ubuntu systems with one or two compute GPUs.
# Not intended to run automatically at system startup, sorry!  However,
# once kicked off, should be good until reboot.
#
# See 'nvscmd' script for the rudimentary fan control policy (one designed
# to eek out a few percent more perf with very noticeable but still
# tolerable fan noise).
